# Quantum University Management System (QUMS)

QUMS is a completely secure version of the ERP system for Quantum University, powered by their own backend servers. This project represents the frontend of the system.

This ERP only supports student login. If your'e not a student or part of faculty/staff, I recommend you to login through the official ERP. 

## Features

- Secure connection to Quantum University's official servers
- No data is sent to any third-party servers
- User-friendly interface

3. Install the dependencies:
